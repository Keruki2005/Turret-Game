# Turret-Game
Hi, this is a little "Turret Minigame written in python" including little dots you can shoot with the turret. For every dot you hit, you get score points. If your turret gets hit by the dots to often you die...  It's just written from scratch, so don't expect high-end performance and hours of exciting gameplay. (But I want to steadily develop it.)
